Thanks to my friend Rodolphe who gave me the idea



#ABOUT GODOT ENGINE
GODOT is an open-source gaming engine like unity but less heavy than ðŸ˜–(u know what i'm talking about ). It has features and is as powerful as unity. I think every game dev has to try it.
If you are not feeling comfortable about using godot script, don't worry godot engine support multiple programming language like python and C# i think C++( not so sure about that one).
